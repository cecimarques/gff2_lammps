(1) Make sure also you put the code for the dihedrals and duly talk about the need to tune more than one potential over the same dihedrals.

(1) A sample of LAMMPS input scripts for OPLS-AA and CGenFF as well as microstates collected during the overall simulation are made available amongst the files of this SM
- put one lammps.in for CGenFF and one for OPLS-AA (pressing part)
- create a folder with *all* final_pos.dat files for each compound within both force fields so that the person can access the parameters ! PS: this should match the simulations in table S1.
- it might be worth also putting some of the step_xxx files !
